The Displays are representations of physical screens in the shop that show the contents to the users. You will need to put each of them in the system to control the contents displayed on them.

*Display Name* is the field to which Displays are referred in the system. This field can be used to select display in screen designs or playlists etc. 

The orientation and resolution fields are present but not actively used in the system at the moment.

## Publish 
### Textual Help
The Publish Button in EasyD allows you to switch between "Public" and "Private" modes for your screens. A screen is private by default which means that it can only be accessible through a paired screen. This is good for those screens that are not meant for public consumption, for example, an organization's internal message board. 

**Using the Publish Button**

**Public Mode:** Generates a unique URL for internet access.

**Private Mode:** Restricts access to paired devices only.


**Best Practices**

 - Use "Public" mode for wide sharing.
 - Use "Private" mode for confidential content.
 - Review and update settings as needed.

**FAQs**

- Switch between modes at any time.
- Pair devices for private viewing.
- User limit for public screens varies.
